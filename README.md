# Hi there üëã

My name is Davide and I'm a Computer Engeneering Student based in Italy.  

My main focus is on backend techonologies such as the Spring framework (Java), databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, noSQL) but I'm also familiar with Python, C and frontend technologies (React, javascript in general). On the devops side I have experience with the services offered by AWS.

‚≠ê Always chase your passions ‚≠ê ,

is my motto because it makes me feel a sense of accomplishment.
